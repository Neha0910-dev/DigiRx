# SureBook - Appointment Booking System Architecture

## Overview
A modern, minimal Flutter appointment booking app with red (#E53935) and pink (#F06292) theme colors, featuring Material 3 design system and comprehensive booking functionality.

## Core Features (MVP)
1. **Authentication** - Login/Signup with basic validation
2. **Doctor Listing** - Grid/card layout with filters and sorting
3. **Doctor Details** - Profile view with available time slots
4. **Appointment Booking** - Date/time selection with confirmation
5. **Payment Flow** - Simple payment UI (placeholder implementation)

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
- Provider for scalable state management
- Separate providers for different concerns (auth, doctors, appointments)

### Data Storage
- SharedPreferences for local storage of user preferences and simple data
- In-memory data models for doctors and appointments with realistic sample data

### Folder Structure

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Theme & Core Setup
1. Update theme with red/pink color scheme
2. Add required dependencies (provider, shared_preferences)
3. Set up folder structure and constants

### Phase 2: Authentication
1. Create user model and auth provider
2. Build login/signup screens with validation
3. Implement basic auth state management

### Phase 3: Doctor System
1. Create doctor model with sample data
2. Build doctor listing with filters and search
3. Implement doctor detail screen with time slots

### Phase 4: Booking Flow
1. Create appointment model and provider
2. Build booking screen with date/time selection
3. Add confirmation and payment placeholder screens

### Phase 5: Integration & Polish
1. Connect all screens with navigation
2. Add animations and micro-interactions
3. Test and debug the complete flow

## Key Design Decisions
- Material 3 design system for modern look
- Provider for predictable state management
- Card-based layouts for clean organization
- Responsive design for iOS/Android compatibility
- Local storage for MVP simplicity (no backend required)

## Sample Data Strategy
- 10+ realistic doctor profiles with different specialties
- Varied time slots and availability patterns
- Different price points and ratings
- Realistic appointment scenarios for testing
